# React_Native_Tasks-App

Here's a simple Tasks App made with RN & Expo, that allows you to manage a list of tasks/goals.
As I'm learning React Native by doing this app, any suggestion will be much apreciated ;)

## Known Issue

Some HEX colors may not display the same way on an emulated device and a real device (much darker on my real device for example). 
It seems to be so because of the Theme that has been set on the device, or because of the custom Android ROM.

I'll soon dive further into this issue but like I said, I'm still learning mobile development so any answer/suggestion would be much appreciated ;)

## Installation

Make sure that you have Node + npm installed on your system.

Then clone this repo, open a terminal, go to your folder,
and execute the following

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash

# run the app
expo start

# run the app on Android
expo start --android

# run the app on IOS
expo start --ios

# run the app on the Web
expo start --web
```

You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go App if you want to check your changes on a real phone.
Or you can start an emulator such as Android Studio's.

## Credits

This App is based on a tutorial video made by "Academind", please consider watching it if you're interested in React Native.

Have fun ;)
