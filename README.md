# React_Native_Tasks-App

Here's a simple Tasks App made with RN & Expo, that allows you to manage a list of tasks/goals.
As I'm learning React Native by doing this app, any suggestion will be much apreciated ;)

## Installation

Make sure that you have Node + npm installed on your system.

Then clone this repo, open a terminal, go to your folder,
and execute the following

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash

# run the app
expo start

# run the app on Android
expo start --android

# run the app on IOS
expo start --ios

# run the app on the Web
expo start --web
```

You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go App if you want to check your changes on a real phone.
Or you can start an emulator such as Android Studio's.

## Credits

This App is based on a tutorial video made by "Academind", please consider watching it if you're interested in React Native.

Have fun ;)
